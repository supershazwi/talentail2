# Typeface-Inter-UI

The CSS and web font files to easily self-host the [Inter UI font family](https://rsms.me/inter/) created by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me).

This repository is just a means of more easily distributing the font. It tracks the  releases of the main [inter repository](https://github.com/rsms/inter) as best as I am able.

At present it only contains the `woff` and `woff2` formats. As a result it supports versions of Chrome 5; Safari 5.1; Firefox 3.6; Opera 11.5; IE 9; Android 4.4; iOS 5.1 and above.
